# Deployment Guide

Your website is production-ready for deployment on Netlify.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following services set up:
1.  **Supabase Project**: For the waitlist database.
2.  **Resend Account**: For sending emails.

## Environment Variables

You must set the following environment variables in your Netlify Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` | Your Supabase Project URL | Yes |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase Anon Key (Public) | Yes |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Your Supabase Service Role Key (Keep this secret!) | Yes |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Your Resend API Key | Yes |


## Domain Verification (Resend)

For the best email deliverability and to avoid "via resend.dev" labels:
1.  Add your domain (`myglo.app`) to your Resend account.
2.  Verify the DNS records provided by Resend.
3.  Once verified, the emails will be sent from `hello@myglo.app`.

## Build Settings

Netlify should automatically detect the settings, but if asked:
-   **Build Command**: `npm run build`
-   **Publish Directory**: `.next` (handled by plugin) or leave default.
-   **Plugins**: `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` (Included in `netlify.toml`)

## Database Setup

Ensure your Supabase database has a `waitlist` table:

```sql
create table waitlist (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  email text unique not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```
